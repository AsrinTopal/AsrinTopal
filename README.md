# Welcome to my personal README file!
## 🚀 About Me
### Hi, my name is ASRIN TOPAL. 
### I am currently studying Computer Engineering at Bahçeşehir University and Visual Communication Design on Anadolu University but my main field is Computer Engineering. Computer engineering is a field that combines elements of electrical engineering and computer science to design and develop computer systems. This can include hardware, software, and networking systems.

### 🖥️ Some specific areas of computer engineering include:

- 🖥️Computer architecture and design
- 🖥️- 🖥️Embedded systems
- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️ VLSI (very-large-scale integration) design
- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️ Computer networks and communication systems
- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️- 🖥️ Software engineering

### As a computer engineer, I have experience in several programming languages such as C++, Python, and Java. I am also familiar with hardware design and implementation, including microcontroller programming and circuit design.
  * I am particularly interested in the development of embedded systems, which are computer systems integrated into other devices or products. These systems are found in a wide range of applications, from consumer electronics to industrial control systems.
  * I am also well-versed in software engineering, including the use of software development methodologies such as Agile and Scrum.

##Overall, I am passionate about using my skills in computer engineering to create innovative and reliable systems that solve real-world problems.

If you have any questions or would like to work together, please don't hesitate to reach out.

I have experinced about Game Developement, Website Designing and Coding, Simple Coding Projects and so on.
